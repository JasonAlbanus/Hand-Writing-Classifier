# Hand-Writing-Classifier

Hand writing classifier for Machine Learning class project

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset

## To download the sample data

run the python file, install any missing pip dependencies

- `$> python3 ./download-dataset.py`

this avoids pushing it to the repo. take my word, unless ya'll wanna wait an
afternoon for a `git pull`, this is the way to go.
