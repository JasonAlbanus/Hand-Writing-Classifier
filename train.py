# psuedo code for training
'''
need hyper parameters (epochs, nini-batch, learning rate, seed value for rng)
start rng
normalize and probably grey-scale images
split data set
create optimiser and loss function (idk)
epoch loop (big)
    bunch of shit we gotta do for this
save trained weights somewhere somehow
boom training done
